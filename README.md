# 🚀 MODEL Project – Polynomial Multiplication Benchmark (C)

This project implements and benchmarks multiple polynomial multiplication algorithms in **C**, including classical and high-performance methods. It is designed to help compare **speed and accuracy** for polynomials of various degrees.

---

## 📚 Algorithms Covered
1. **Naive Classical Multiplication**  
2. **Karatsuba Multiplication**  
3. **Toom-Cook Multiplication**  
4. **Toom-4 Multiplication**  
5. **Naive Multiplication using MPFR library** ([MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/)) for high-precision computations

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### On macOS
```bash
brew install gcc gmp mpfr
```

## On Debian-based systems / WSL
```bash
apt install build-essential libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev
```

## ⚡ Procedure / How It Works

1. Prepare Polynomials:
    Define your polynomials in main.c. Example polynomials are already provided.

2. Run the Algorithms:
    main.c is the driver that runs all algorithms on the defined polynomials. Each algorithm is implemented in its respective .h file.

3. Benchmark and Compare:
    Execution time is measured for each algorithm. 
    Results are printed in a readable polynomial format.
    High-precision results are computed with the MPFR library for comparison.

4. Adjust Parameters:
    For Karatsuba, Toom-Cook, and Toom-4, adjust the k parameter to see its impact on performance.
